# Contenta Flutter

Contenta Flutter is an example consumer for the [Contenta CMS](https://www.contentacms.org/). Contenta CMS is an API-first Drupal distribution. Contenta Flutter provides a learning opportunity for technologies and concepts, including decoupled Drupal 8, Google Firebase Firestore, and Flutter.

The Flutter app is a decoupled Drupal frontend for the Umami Food Magazine demo content that is an experiemntal Drupal 8 install profile.

>Umami is a fictional food magazine that has been created to demonstrate how you might build a Drupal site using functionality provided 'out of the box'.

## Technical Architecture

* The Flutter app reads recipe data from the [Contenta CMS JSON API endpoint](https://dev-contentacms.pantheonsite.io/api).
* User interactions such as marking recipes as favorites are saved to a Google Firebase Firestore.
